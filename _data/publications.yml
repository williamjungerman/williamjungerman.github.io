  abstract: This paper examines the international financial consequences of Brexit.It first pro- vides a survey of the still limited literature on EU membership and international capital flows. It then provides new estimates of the impact of Brexit on cross-border investment utilizing data from the IMFâ€™s Consolidated Portfolio Investment Survey. It lastly provides a comparative analysis of these same issues using data on cross- border capital flows from the BIS. The conclusion is that the impact on cross-border capital flows to and from the UK is likely to be substantial.
