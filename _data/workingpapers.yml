  abstract: What are the sources of worker learning within the firm? How much of a worker's human capital growth comes from firm specific factors, such as the learning environment, as opposed to their own ability, and the composition of their coworkers?  In this paper, we introduce a novel labor search model with multi-worker firms, learning from coworkers, and heterogeneity in learning-by-doing rates that can vary at the worker and firm level. Despite its complexity, we show that it is possible to solve such a model by leveraging recent advances from the machine learning literature. We use French administrative data to discipline the parameters of the model, specifically by targeting how wage growth varies across workers, firms, and the distribution of coworker wages.  With the calibrated model in hand we perform a series of structural and statistical decompositions to test how much of the variance of human capital is driven by learning from coworkers and by heterogeneous learning-by-doing, and find that learning from coworkers is the dominant source of learning in the economy. Switching off learning from coworkers lowers human capital and wages by more than 25%, and differences in the composition of coworkers accounts for more than 50% of the variance of human capital growth rates. Finally, we use the model to calculate dynamic markdowns that price in the benefits of learning on the job and find that markdowns are less than 5% on average for workers with more than 1 year of experience at their current firm.

  abstract: A number of influential papers study monopsony power in static models. Among the papers that model dynamics with a finite number of firms, none model the process of human capital accumulation by workers. In this paper, I show that this has important implications for the measurement and welfare consequences of monopsony power. How large are properly measured markdowns? And what are the welfare gains of implementing competitive allocations once we have accounted for human capital accumulation? To answer these questions, I introduce a novel model of dynamic monopsony in which a large non-atomistic firm competes with a finite number of homogeneous firms for workers who learn on-the-job. The markdown has an additional dynamic term reflecting expected future changes in worker human capital. I estimate the model using rich matched employee-employer administrative data from France and find that the welfare gains from forcing firms to offer workers their marginal product are large. Moreover, the welfare losses are underestimated by 81% when ignoring human capital accumulation.

#   abstract: This paper develops a method to estimate production functions when some inputs are unobserved. Due to data limitations in the U.S., there are no firm-level total factor productivity estimates for privately owned firms outside of the Manufacturing sector. We circumvent this issue by relying on the richness of matched employer-employee data instead. We extend the standard methodology by splitting the labor input into a predetermined stock of high skill workers and a flexible choice of low skill workers. This additional structure allows us to not only identify the model parameters, but also recover the unobserved productivity and capital stock of the firm. We provide a series of Monte Carlo experiments to validate our estimation algorithm, and we show that it is robust to alternate parameterizations of the production function and relaxations of our baseline assumptions.

  abstract: "This paper examines how the business cycle impacts the average quality of an employer-employee match. I study a model of the labor market with on-the-job search, aggregate uncertainty, and heterogeneous match qualities. I test two theories: the cleansing effect, whereby the low quality matches are destroyed during recessions, and the sullying effect, whereby firms post fewer vacancies during recessions and workers have fewer opportunities to move up the job ladder. I find that the sullying effect dominates and that average match quality is procyclical due to increased hiring out of unemployment during recessions. I extend the model to allow for an exogenous minimum wage and show that neglecting to account for the cyclicality of match qualities can lead to miscalculating the effects of the policy."
